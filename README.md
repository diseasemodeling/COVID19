# COVID-19 decision-analysis simulation model 
This is an interactive simulaton tool to evaluate user-input options for social distancing, contact tracing and testing, and universal testing. 

## To run the simulation model: 
1. Click on below model link to open the code in Colab (you will have to log in to your google account) 

      [model link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GXs3hBg68w23-Kv5GCFQI30KKRxsfyFP) 
      
      (The simulation model is built in Python, if you run it in Google Colab you do not have to install any software)

2. In Colab click on 'Runtime-->Run all'
      
      Follow instructions given by model to enter the decisons you would like to evaluate for 
      - Reduction in contacts  (social distancing measures)
      - Contact tracing and testing capacity
      - Universal testing capacity
